At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without help, the following:
-  What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
-  What is malloc and free and how to use them
-  Why and when use malloc
-  How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

2.  File 1-strdup.c is a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

3.  File 2-str_concat.c is a function that concatenates two strings.

4.  File 3-alloc_grid.c is a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

5.  File 4-free_grid.c is a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by our alloc_grid function.

6.  File 5-argstostr.c is a function that concatenates all the arguments of our program.

7.  File 100-strtow.c is a function that splits a string into words.
